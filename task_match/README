match_sound.m [delete]
    test: do MFCC, DTW, and classify testing word to the class with minimal DTW distance

test_sound.m [delete]
    test: get speech_word trace and combine different/same words together to calculate the rank

get_trace_word.m [delete]
    used by test_sound.m to get speech_word trace and combine different/same words together

match_single.m
    get data in 3D format, seperate to training and testing, DTW and classification

match_group.m
    1. get data in 2D format
        user 1,feature 1: time series
        ...
        user 1,feature n: time series
        user 2,feature 1: time series
        ...
        user 2,feature n: time series
        ...
    2. find dominating features:
        project data points to each feature and apply greedy search
    3. in training data, cluster users in the same class/activity, and find cluster head
    4. in testing data, calculate distance to each cluster and choose the one with minimal distance as the distance of the class.
    5. the testing data is classified to the one with minimal distance
